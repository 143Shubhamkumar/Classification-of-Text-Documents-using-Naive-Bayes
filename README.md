Classification of Text Documents using Naive Bayes


**Classification of Text Documents using Naive Bayes**

This project demonstrates how to use the Naive Bayes algorithm for text document classification. The model classifies documents into categories based on their content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

**Requirements**

Install the required dependencies before running the notebook:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

**How to Run**

Run the cells step by step to:

• Preprocess the text data

• Convert text to numerical features (Bag of Words / TF-IDF)

• Train a Naive Bayes classifier

• Evaluate model performance

**Workflow**

1. Data Preprocessing

• Clean and tokenize text

• Remove stopwords and special characters

• Convert text into vectors (CountVectorizer / TF-IDF)

2. Model Training

• Train Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB) on text features

3. Model Evaluation

• Accuracy Score

• Confusion Matrix

• Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

• Visualization of results
